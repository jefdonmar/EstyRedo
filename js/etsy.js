Choose your champion, or cheer for all of them! :)\n\nLimited stocks! We only have a few pieces on hand, and not sure yet when the next batch will be available.\n\nIMPORTANT - PLEASE READ\n- This is handmade and intended as fashion jewelry. Please do NOT expect that this would be in the same league as that of commercial and official Harry Potter pieces (which I also want for myself actually!!). The locket flaps open when the top lock is twisted, but it&#39;s quite hard to make them perfectly level with each other.  \n- The necklaces are made one by one so each is unique. It comes with a bright teardrop crystal and your choice of chain. \n- As with all metal jewelry, do not get it wet or store moist\/damp. To clean, wipe with a soft cloth.\n\nDIMENSIONS\nChain: 20 inches in two options\n- Silver (I intended this one for Gryffindor, but it could also match Cedric&#39;s grey eyes and Fleur&#39;s hair)\n- Black (see last photo; for Hufflepuff or to match Harry&#39;s and Viktor&#39;s black hair)\n\nPendant: \n-  Width: about 1&quot;\n-  Height: about 1.5&quot;\n\nSHIPPING SCHEDULE:\nAllow 2-4 weeks for international shipping from MANILA, the Philippines, give or take a few days for delivery from your local post office to you.

Further details below.","policy_shipping":"I ship during weekdays only, except for rush orders (if so please place a note on the order form). I try to keep weekends free to make new items and custom orders.\r\n\r\nI use standard local (transit 1-3 days) and registered international shipping (transit 2-4 weeks depending on location). Tracking numbers will be sent once available from the couriers. We use Philpost, Xend Express, SingPost, and then your country&#39;s mail service. Follow ups will course through 1-2 of these companies.\r\n\r\nFor priority (1 week) and insured shipping, notify me in advance for cost computation. I will then make a special listing for you. This usually costs USD 35-40 based on package weight and location. The highest so far was USD 65 for the Middle East.\r\n\r\nI try to check on the orders 1-2 times and send updates, but kindly consider that there&#39;s only ONE of me and a lot of shipments.

Sometimes the package may just need to be followed up from your local post office. :)\r\n\r\nPLEASE do not hold me responsible for delayed or lost mail when the package has clearly reached your country. Just send me a note and I&#39;ll do my best to follow up from here. However, we are NOT responsible for:\r\n- customs clearance delays, as we really do not know what happens here\r\n- unavailable recipients, in which case your post office will usually leave a notice for you to call them or pick up the package\r\n- incorrect addresses (I use the one on your order form, make sure it&#39;s correct)\r\n- no secure location (ask your post office for details)\r\n- others specified by the courier on why they cannot deliver ","policy_refunds":"Items are checked prior to standard shipping, and refunds are NOT allowed for shipped items. Apologies, but this is part of seller protection. However, special circumstances may be discussed and agreed on, ONLY in the following cases:\r\n\r\n1. Refund item and shipping cost - allowed only for un-shipped items. I personally check items prior to shipping, and DO NOT send damaged items. Pieces may be joggled in transit despite its bubble wrapping. Shipping delays are not included as that is not under our control. See above other reasons. I use registered mail so I can track all my shipments if they arrived or not. We cover the insurance cost.\r\n \r\n2. Refund for ITEM cost only - this is allowed only if the item is returned to me AND I receive it in the same condition that it was sent. I would require photos of the waybill with my name and address. Note that items may take about 2-6 months to get to me. I have experienced a few cases where the customer refunded their order but I did not receive the item, and they do not provide tracking or any means to trace shipment. \r\n\r\nPleas also consider the above scenarios before leaving any neutral or negative Reviews. I am very easy to talk to and I believe in win-win situations. If you&#39;re not happy with the transaction for ANY reason, just message me first and we can work it out.

Too precious! Thank you SO much for the quick shipping...amazing!!&quot;\n******************************************************************************\n\nThis Harry Potter inspired faux tie and collar combo has alternating single and double thin stripes and is a toddler version of my regular sized listing. It was used as a great photo prop in one of my customer&#39;s professional photo shoots, as pictured. It is designed for 1-4 year olds, and comes in three tie length options: Small (8&quot;), Medium (10&quot;) and Large (12&quot;). Tie lengths are approximate and may vary up to half an inch.  Ties can be shortened but not lengthened, so err on the long side if you are unsure. Please measure your child from the neck down to an inch below the waist to select the proper size.  Custom sizing is available upon request. No refunds will be given for ordering the wrong size, so please message me with any questions prior to ordering.  For infant sized ties, please see this listing: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/220652733\/harry-potter-inspired-infant-striped-tie?ref=shop_home_active_1\n\nNo need for a separate dress shirt - just pop it over a comfortable white t-shirt - an especially convenient feature for little people!  White collar is made of high quality comfortable felt that creates the look of a dress shirt. Faux tie is made of satin ribbon which is securely sewn to the collar. Collar wraps around neck and attaches with velcro in the back, making it very quick and easy to put on and take off. The velcro will stick anywhere to the felt collar, so it is adjustable within a few of inches.\n\nROBE NOT INCLUDED OR AVAILABLE.\n\nTHIS ITEM MAY BE A CHOKING\/STRANGULATION HAZARD - ADULT SUPERVISION REQUIRED AT ALL TIMES.  CUSTOMER&#39;S PAYMENT FOR THIS ITEM CONSTITUTES THE LEGAL RELEASE OF ALL LIABILITY OF SNAPPY PEA FOR ANY INJURY THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE USE OF THIS ITEM.\n\nStriped tie is available for all 4 Hogwarts Houses:\nGryffindor - Scarlet Tie with Gold Stripes\nSlytherin - Green Tie with Silver Stripes\nRavenclaw - Blue Tie with Silver Stripes\nHufflepuff - Yellow Tie with Black Stripes\nMake your selection when ordering.\n\nPlease see my Harry Potter section for the other house tie listings, including party packs and budget-minded solid ties with no stripes, here: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/SnappyPea?section_id=15027652&ref=shopsection_leftnav_4.\n\nCare and cleaning:  Wipe clean with a damp cloth and liquid dish soap if necessary.\n\nI want you to be thrilled with your order.

Be sure to check the estimated shipping date shown on each individual listing for more up-to-date processing time estimates. In addition to the quoted processing time, please allow in-transit time for delivery once your order is processed - most deliveries average 3-5 days in the US. \r\n\r\nRUSH ORDERS\r\nIf you need your item shipped prior to the expected shipment date quoted in the \u201cShipping and Policies\u201d tab of the listing, you can select the &quot;RUSH ORDER PROCESSING&quot; option during check-out in the shipping options.  If you would like to add a rush to an order that has already been paid, you can purchase rush order separately here: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/180991130\/rush-order-options-expedited-priority? Purchasing a rush order will shorten the quoted processing time to the following approximate time frames: \r\n3 Days - 1 Week shortens to 1-2 Days\r\n2 Weeks shortens to 3-5 Days\r\n3 Weeks shortens to 1 Week\r\n4 Weeks shortens to 1-2 Weeks.\r\nDays are business days, Monday - Friday.\r\nProcessing times quoted do not include in-transit delivery time. If you have s specific deadline, please leave a note in your order. If your deadline is earlier than the above quoted rushed time frames, convo me prior to ordering. \r\n\r\nDuring peak holiday seasons, a graduated rush order schedule with specific shipment dates may be available as a shipping option during check-out. In this event, the dated shipment schedule will supersede the normal rush order timing above.\r\n\r\nCASH ON DELIVERY\/POSTAGE UNDERAGE\r\nIn the event that your order is held at the post office or you receive a notice requesting an additional payment for postage, I will only refund up to a $5 overage.  Packages with a larger amount due should be refused and returned to me, because in most cases I can repackage or relabel the item to eliminate the overage.   Customers who opt to pay a postage overage in excess of $5 will be responsible for the overage payment and not reimbursed in full.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\r\nThe listed international shipping price is generally sufficient to cover shipping to most countries.  In the event that the listed amount is not adequate to cover my cost, a shipping surcharge will be requested prior to filling your order.  You will have the option to refuse the surcharge and cancel your order. Snappy Pea does not accept responsibility for damage in transit on international orders.  Most international shipments do not automatically include insurance.  Contact me prior to ordering to add insurance to your order. Depending on your location, international shipments can take 2-3 weeks or longer, so please allow adequate time when ordering.","policy_refunds":"REFUNDS\/RETURNS\r\nBecause all items in my shop are custom made-to-order, I do not stock inventory and do not accept returns or provide refunds for any reason.  Damaged or defective items are rare and eligible for repair or replacement only. Customer must notify shop of any problem within 48 hours of delivery. Photographs and\/or item return may be required for replacement. Contact the shop owner for prior approval and instructions before returning any damaged or defective item.  Unauthorized returns will not be refunded and will only be re-shipped at the customer&#39;s expense.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL ORDERS\r\nInternational Damage: Snappy Pea does not accept responsibility for damage during shipment on International orders. Damage claims on insured International orders must be filed by the customer because the process requires in-person physical proof of damage, which only the customer can provide.\r\n\r\nEU Right of Withdrawal: I do not stock any inventory, and every item in my shop is custom-made to order, special for each customer. As such, each item is hand made and unique, and therefore is considered a custom-made item that is not subject to the EU Right of Withdrawal. By placing an order with Snappy Pea, the customer understands and agrees to abide by the published shop policies with respect to returns, and acknowledges that the order is not eligible for return under the EU Right of Withdrawal. The customer&#39;s payment constitutes the agreement that he\/she will not attempt to dispute the custom nature of his\/her order in any way or attempt invoke the EU Right of Withdrawal to force a return.\r\n\r\nCANCELLATION\r\nAll sales are final. Snappy Pea does not accept any responsibility for assumptions made by the customer that have no basis in the item&#39;s description or published shop policies. In accordance with Etsy&#39;s buyer policies, it is the customer\u2019s responsibility to read the item description, shipping information, and shop policies prior to ordering. Placing an order constitutes the customer&#39;s agreement to all posted shop terms and policies. Cancellation requests MAY be considered at the owner\u2019s discretion if made within 48 hours of ordering and if no investment of time or resources has yet been made on your order. If a policy exception is made to accept a cancellation, a cancellation fee of 25% of the purchase price may be applied, at the shop&#39;s sole discretion.","policy_additional":"NO UNPUBLISHED SHIPPING DISCOUNTS\r\nI do not offer discounted shipping on multiple items for most orders.  Due to the size, weight, and shipping category of most of my items, combining shipments on multiple items usually increases the package size and\/or weight enough to require upgrading the shipping class, which often results in a higher total shipping cost and therefore does not yield any cost savings for me to pass on to my customers.  The few items that weigh little enough to combine without changing the category already have published discount rates for multiple items.

I specialize in making simple and well-designed planners! Please read the FAQ below before messaging me. Thank you!\r\n\r\nQ: When will ____ planner be back in stock?\r\nA: Please check our Facebook for any updates on when planners will be back in stock. At the moment, I&#39;m very busy with orders so I am unable to answer all questions that come through the inbox.\r\n\r\nQ: How long do the planners go for?\r\nA: They go for 12 months (as indicated in the product description). The thin planners can go for 24 months. \r\n\r\nQ: Can you please add extra months to my planner?\r\nA: Sorry, we cannot add extra months. Our spirals only fit a certain amount of pages. It is already at its full capacity so we are unable to add extra months to your planner.\r\n\r\nQ: Can you please take out X amount of months from my planner and reduce the cost?\r\nA: Sorry, but no. While we may use less materials to create this planner, we still have to modify our files to fit these needs. Modifying planners causes an interruption in our printing process. We would prefer not to do this.\r\n\r\nQ: Can you customize the cover?\r\nA: No, we cannot. Our super high-quality covers are purchased in bulk from California (we&#39;re in Wisconsin). Because of shipping costs and the long turn-around time, we don&#39;t offer custom covers. \r\n\r\nQ: Can you switch the cover for me? I like the inside layout of this planner better but would prefer another cover instead.\r\nA: Yes! I can do that. Just pop it in the Notes section which cover you&#39;d like instead. Please make sure that the cover is in stock, otherwise, it may not be available. NOTE: You CANNOT switch covers for SALE items. \r\n\r\nQ: Can you customize\/personalize\/resize a planner?\r\nA: Sorry, we do not do customized or personalized orders. Developing a new planner design is a very long process. Due to time constraints, we cannot create a custom planner for you. We do accept suggestions though! Feel free to let us know! The more people who request a certain theme or idea, the bigger the chance of it being created.\r\n","currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":"Hello!

Our super high-quality covers are purchased in bulk from California (we&#39;re in Wisconsin). Because of shipping costs and the long turn-around time, we don&#39;t offer custom covers. \r\n\r\nQ: Can you switch the cover for me? I like the inside layout of this planner better but would prefer another cover instead.\r\nA: Yes! I can do that. Just pop it in the Notes section which cover you&#39;d like instead. Please make sure that the cover is in stock, otherwise, it may not be available. NOTE: You CANNOT switch covers for SALE items. \r\n\r\nQ: Can you customize\/personalize\/resize a planner?\r\nA: Sorry, we do not do customized or personalized orders. Developing a new planner design is a very long process. Due to time constraints, we cannot create a custom planner for you. We do accept suggestions though! Feel free to let us know! The more people who request a certain theme or idea, the bigger the chance of it being created.\r\n\r\nQ: Can you please add extra months to my planner?\r\nA: Sorry, we cannot add extra months. Our spirals only fit a certain amount of pages. It is already at its full capacity so we are unable to add extra months to your planner.\r\n\r\nQ: Can you please take out X amount of months from my planner and reduce the cost?\r\nA: Sorry, but no. While we may use less materials to create this planner, we still have to modify our files to fit these needs. Modifying planners causes an interruption in our printing process. We would prefer not to do this.","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1438611586,"vacation_autoreply":"Hello!\r\n\r\nThis is an automated message.

Im my opinion this house does not get enough credit. \nThe black yarn is slightly embilished with a small amount of silver.

They are comfortable and soft to the touch. All of these scarves are handmade by me, and I take the up most care in every project i create.\n\nI do have pets, although i DO NOT allow them near my projects.\n\n**If you live outside of the United States and are interested in this product, please convo me for shipping information**\n\nThank you to Waffle Box for allowing me to create some scarves for their youtube video. \nPlease check out their channel!

Start with your thumb and index fingers of each hand in the four pockets of the Fortune Teller. \n2. Have the person whose fortune is being read ask a yes or no question and then pick one of the colors on the top four flaps. \n3. If the color is Blue, spell out the letters of blue while alternating a pinching and pulling motion with the Teller. \n4. Each pinch will expose four of the numbers on the inner flaps, and each pull will expose the other four numbers. \n5. After spelling out B-L-U-E, the Teller will be showing one of the sets of four numbers. \n6. The other player will then pick one of those numbers, and the responding action is the alternating pinch and pull from the first round, except it continues with a counting of the number instead of the spelling of the color. \n7.
