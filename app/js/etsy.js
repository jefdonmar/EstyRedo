LISTING: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/186169097\r\n\r\nDESIGN&#39;S THE LIMIT CUSTOM ARTWORK! Custom made or one of a kind, Design&#39;s the Limit will create a piece of art to your specifications on a piece of glass or mirror to your specified dimensions and ship it to you. We are only limited by the inspiration you provide! Design&#39;s the Limit offers custom made display artwork for your special interest or desire. When you place your order, the non-refundable deposit will allow us to create and submit a design proof and estimate for your approval based on the information and the inspiration you provide. You do not have the rights to reproduce the designs we submit and your deposit is strictly for the time to create your design and estimate the cost of completing and shipping your artwork with Design&#39;s the Limit reserving the rights to the designs which may not be reproduced by others under any circumstances. Design&#39;s the Limit reserves the rights to all of our images and artistic creations as the sole intellectual property of Design&#39;s the Limit, LLC. Reproduction of our images or artwork is strictly prohibited. Every piece of artwork we produce will include a signature (and print number unless created as a one-of-a-kind unique design masterpiece). When specified as a one-of-a-kind design before making a purchase, we will never again reproduce the image we create for you to make your artwork a truly unique artistically inspired design creation. DESIGN&#39;S THE LIMIT&#39;S CUSTOM DISPLAY ARTWORK - \r\nMASTERPIECE LISTING: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/176383600\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ETCHED, ENGRAVED, AND CARVED?\r\nWhen it comes to personalizing, there is such a wide variety of artists and styles available that we can not cover them all in this explanation. Design&#39;s the Limit employs a combination and variety of techniques including occasional chemical etching, laser engraving for many items, and sandblasted carving depending on the item, the desired effect, and the customer request. Laser engraving offers many advantages, but has it&#39;s own limitations and sandblasted carving gives a desired effect while delaying completion time and increasing costs. Design&#39;s the Limit offers a sandblasted listing for any glassware purchase and for all customer&#39;s who prefer the method of sandblasting: SANDBLASTING: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/176565485\/sandblast\r\n\r\nCAN I ORDER MY BEER MUG OR COFFEE CUP HANDED? Yes, if you specify that you would like your mug for left handed or right handed orientation Design&#39;s the Limit will fill your order as you have requested at no additional charge. As there is no consensus as to the proper orientation and we often fill orders with engraving on both sides of the mug, we generally complete orders as shown in the main product images. Unless the customer specifies the desired handing at the time of purchase, we reserve the right to complete each order as we see fit depending on the characteristics of the mugs purchased and the design specified. Please let us know if you have any questions or special requests and we would be happy to complete your order to your specifications. We do not accept buyers remorse and it is the customers responsibility to specify handing when making a purchase.\r\n\r\nIS THE GLASSWARE DISHWASHER SAFE? They are dishwasher safe, the engraving is permanently engraved, and the designs will not come off. Tatiana and I have a difference of opinion on this matter, as she believes that some dishwashers and some dish detergents will leave small scratches on any glass. She recommends hand-washing with warm water and a soft, non-abrasive sponge. We put a lot of effort into creating our art, so we hand-wash them before packaging. Our designs are permanently engraved in the glassware we sell and cannot be removed in the dishwasher. It is the customers responsibility and decision on the method of cleaning the products, but we recommend cleaning thoroughly when you products arrive before use. We assume no liability for the glassware other than the artistic service we provide.\r\n\r\nARE THE CUTTING BOARDS FOOD SAFE? The cutting boards and cheese boards are permanently engraved. We like to say the design is already there and just needs to be uncovered. We do not add any product that is not considered food safe to the surface of any of our cutting boards or cheese boards. We recommend cleaning your products thoroughly when they arrive before using and accept no liability for the products we sell only the artistic service we provide. Please read hold-harmless policy below. NOTE: Do not submerge cutting boards or cheese boards in water, surface wash with damp cloth with water only. Do not clean with any substance other than water and do not put in the dishwasher. Submerging wood in water or running through the dishwasher will cause the product to warp or crack and all sales are final. Recommend applying food safe cutting board oil on a semi-regular basis to extend the life of the product.\r\n\r\nARE CRYSTAL GLASSES SAFE? We sell 100 % Lead-Free Crystal in almost every instance, but as we are not the manufacturer of the crystal can not accept any liability for the use of crystal products. Although generally accepted as safe for use during short periods of time and on an infrequent basis, leaded crystal stemware and decanters pose a significant health risk and proper cleaning and handling instructions should be followed with every use. Design&#39;s the Limit recommends washing thoroughly before and after each use. Design&#39;s the Limit does not recommend storing liquids in the leaded crystal products for longer than needed to entertain and never more than a few hours. Leaded crystal products should be used responsibly by consenting adults only. Design&#39;s the Limit recommends all customers not familiar with leaded crystal products research the subject independently and all customers accept responsibility for the products they purchase and agree to hold Design&#39;s the Limit harmless in accordance with our shop policies. Many of the crystal decanters and crystal stemware we offer are 100% lead free optic crystal and are considered safe for storing liquids in for longer periods of time. Please click &quot;Ask a Question,&quot; if you would like additional information about any other products we sell. Leaded crystal product listings are identified as such in the product information.\r\n\r\nCAN I ORDER MY PEN OR PENCIL SET HANDED? You can specify handing for a pen or pencil at the time of purchase, but it is not necessary. When you place an order for a pen or pencil with engraving on one side, we engrave your name or information opposite the pen clip. If you specify or purchase engraving on both sides, we engrave your name or information on both sides of the pen or pencil. You can also choose to specify a name on one side of the pen and a job title, company name, or other information on the opposite side of the pen or pencil. Our listing for the metal pen includes three sides which you may choose to have engraved with different information on each side. Design is Limited only by your requests. Design the time to make your personal gift perfectly unique.\r\n\r\nDOES THE TOOTHBOX SCREW ON? No, the lid does not fall off if you turn the toothbox upside down and it is perfect for storing teeth and putting under the pillow. To remove the top you have to pull upward. To prevent the box from coming open and a tooth or coins from falling out, we provide a gift pouch with every toothbox. It is the customers responsibility to use the toothbox properly including cleaning anything you wish to store and drying prior to storage for an extended period of time. Design&#39;s the Limit accepts no responsibility for the box, only the artwork provided for personalization and the toothbox is not a food safe item in which a food safe finish has been applied.\r\n\r\nDO YOU OFFER QUANTITY DISCOUNTS OR OTHER PROMOTIONS: Design&#39;s the Limit offers an increasing percentage discount based on the quantity purchased of any item in our shop. Design&#39;s the Limit also posts coupon codes and special offers on Twitter and our Facebook page and ask all customers to please like and share before using the coupon codes found there. Design&#39;s the Limit will not retroactively issue refunds for quantity discounts, so make sure to use select the appropriate listing for the quantity you wish to purchase, request a custom listing for any quantity over one dozen, and enter the coupon code at the time of purchase. Please click &quot;Request a Custom Order&quot; and we will create a listing for any quantity you wish to purchase if you include your zip code for shipping. All of the products we sell are intended to be used or given as gifts by the customer who purchases them. We do not offer products for wholesale and do not give any of our customers the right or permission to resell any of the items in our shop without contacting us before they place an order. All sales are final and we encourage all of our customers to read the product listings, read our shop policies, and contact us for any questions they may have before making a purchase.\r\n\r\nWHAT IF THE PRODUCT IS DAMAGED IN SHIPPING? Design&#39;s the Limit makes every effort to ensure that your product arrives safely, but occasionally shipping damage does occur. We recommend that all customers open their package as soon as it arrives and contact us if there is any problems with the items you have purchased. We will assist you with a shipping damage claim, but only handle the shipping claims if additional shipping insurance is included at the time of purchase. Design&#39;s the Limit recommends that all customers select either USPS Priority Mail, USPS Priority Express Mail, or purchase additional shipping insurance from our shop when they place their order. The USPS includes insurance for all USPS Priority Mail and USPS Priority Express Mail shipments, but it is the customers sole responsibility to submit and handle shipping claims directly with the USPS unless additional insurance is included at the time of purchase from either the shipping options drop down menu at checkout or by adding this listing to your shopping cart: INSURANCE LISTING: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/187324452\/insurance. If you purchase additional insurance at the time of purchase, we will require you to a.) Submit multiple pictures of the product and packaging, b.) Complete, sign, and return a statement about the shipping damage, and c.) Store the damaged item until shipping claims can be resolved. Please contact us within 24 hours of receiving your package for any claims.\r\n\r\nWHAT IF AN ITEM WAS DAMAGED IN SHIPPING, BUT I DID NOT PURCHASE SHIPPING INSURANCE WHEN I PLACED MY ORDER? If you elected not to purchase additional shipping insurance or to have your item shipped USPS Priority Mail or USPS Priority Express then you will have to purchase a replacement item from our listings, but Design&#39;s the Limit will still offer you the following: \r\n1.) Upgrade your order to a rush order at no charge and complete your order and ship your replacement without delay. \r\n2.) Upgrade your shipping to USPS Priority Mail at no additional charge even if you select standard shipping at checkout.\r\n3.) Offer you a partial refund when your order is complete to include a discount for the total quantity purchased, refund for shipping overage if possible, and an additional discount depending on the product purchased. \r\nTo qualify for this offer you must contact us within 24 hours of receiving your package and e-mail us pictures of the damaged item and packaging for our records to info@designsthelimit.com. Design&#39;s the Limit makes every effort to package our items to avoid any potential problems as a result of shipping, but can not be held responsible for the safe handling of your package and recommends customers purchase additional insurance or upgrade to USPS Priority Mail with every purchase.\r\n\r\nWHAT IF I AM ORDERING MORE THAN ONE OF THE SAME PRODUCT:\r\nWhen ordering more than one of any product we offer, you will notice product variations.. Many products have a distinct character inherent in the materials nature including wood, glass, stone, and other materials. Any product, when purchased, will have individual characteristics due to the nature of the product which are not considered defects. These variations are to be expected, are considered desirable, and give each a unique appeal. We do not accept returns or offer refunds for buyer remorse or dislike for a particular grain, pattern, variation, or other characteristic of the product when it is received. We make every effort to purchase quality products which can be admired and put to good use for years to come. Design&#39;s the Limit gifts are unique just like the service we provide.\r\n\r\nWHAT IF I WISH TO CANCEL MY ORDER: Once an order has been placed, our shop policies do not allow for cancellation, but if you would like to make any changes to your order let us know and we will be happy to assist you.

As soon as we receive the purchase of a change of address listing, we mark the first order as shipped to ensure that your order is shipped to the address you prefer. If requesting a change of address to the state of Virginia, we can only honor your request if the address originally entered during checkout is in the state of Virginia. We recommend entering the address you would like your package shipped to at the time of purchase and we do not guarantee and can not be held responsible for changing the order shipping address or communicating with the USPS, FedEx, UPS, or other shipping providers once your order has been shipped and is beyond our control.

Save all packaging and the item that has been broken. The insurance provider does not always require you to ship the broken item, but the item must be stored until the insurance claim is resolved. Customer&#39;s are responsible for resolving shipping claims for USPS Priority and USPS Priority Express insurance provided by the USPS. Design&#39;s the Limit standard listings include USPS Parcel Select 2-9 day or USPS First Class shipping with no insurance. Design&#39;s the Limit may upgrade your shipping to USPS Priority Mail 1-3 days which includes insurance provided by the USPS, but Design&#39;s the Limit will only handle the insurance claim if our additional third party shipping insurance is purchased before your order is shipped. FILE A SHIPPING DAMAGE CLAIM: www.usps.com\/help\/claims.htm\r\n\r\nSHIPPING INSURANCE: Design&#39;s the Limit offers additional insurance which may be purchased for any listing at an additional charge and will handle any insurance claims for orders which purchase the additional insurance. To submit a claim for an item which additional insurance was purchased, we require you to keep the broken item until any shipping claims can be resolved, submit a signed testimonial about the condition of the product and the packaging when it arrived, and provide proof in form of multiple digital pictures that can be emailed to info@designsthelimit.com. For faster service, please include your order number. After we receive multiple digital pictures of the damaged product in the original packaging with a signed testimonial, we will submit a claim with the insurance provider. Customer&#39;s must purchase replacement items or wait until shipping claims can be resolved. If the customer decides to purchase the item again, a full refund will be issued on completion of the shipping claim. If the customer decides to wait until the shipping claim is resolved, a replacement will be issued and shipped at no charge after the claim is resolved. It is the customer&#39;s responsibility to ensure that insurance is included with the shipping of their packages.

This beautiful Napa Valley scene has been hand burned into vineyard reclaimed wood to create to an art piece. \n\n The wood frame was selected to contrast with the vineyard reclaimed wood piece.   It&#39;s a great piece to display over fireplaces, mini bars, game rooms, wine cellars, etc. This handmade piece captures the heart of aficionados, collectors, and wine lover.

While gathering ideas, I began to notice the importance of originality, context, and character in the wine trade.  There&#39;s great pride (from grape seed, to vine, to wine) in the product vineyards and wineries put their names to.  In contrast, there&#39;s great contextual appreciation when an aficionado selects a bottle or glass of wine from a specific country, region, vineyard, or winery.  To capture this essence, I found myself working with original materials including reclaimed wood pieces.  These materials tell a story much like the taste of a sip of wine does.","creation_tsz":1448831694,"ending_tsz":1459282494,"original_creation_tsz":1416969635,"last_modified_tsz":1448831694,"price":"138.99","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"tags":["california","wood burn","napa valley","Wine art","Reclaimed","Reclaimed wood","Wood frame","wine","wood barrel","vineyard","repurposed wood","whiskey barrel","Barn wood"],"category_path":["Housewares","Home Decor"],"category_path_ids":[69150425,68892008],"materials":[],"shop_section_id":13611786,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1448823644,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/212800837\/handmade-wood-burned-napa-valley-wine?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":172,"num_favorers":10,"shipping_template_id":1377704573,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":3,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2015","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":null,"is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":1029,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Home D\u00e9cor","Wall D\u00e9cor","Wall Hangings"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":688875417,"hex_code":"865F42","red":134,"green":95,"blue":66,"hue":26,"saturation":50,"brightness":52,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1416972101,"listing_id":212800837,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/057\/0\/8135139\/il_75x75.688875417_jbqu.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/057\/0\/8135139\/il_170x135.688875417_jbqu.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/057\/0\/8135139\/il_570xN.688875417_jbqu.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/057\/0\/8135139\/il_fullxfull.688875417_jbqu.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":688757996,"hex_code":"734D34","red":115,"green":77,"blue":52,"hue":24,"saturation":54,"brightness":45,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1416972101,"listing_id":212800837,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/051\/0\/8135139\/il_75x75.688757996_crwi.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/051\/0\/8135139\/il_170x135.688757996_crwi.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/051\/0\/8135139\/il_570xN.688757996_crwi.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/051\/0\/8135139\/il_fullxfull.688757996_crwi.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":688758050,"hex_code":"855B3E","red":133,"green":91,"blue":62,"hue":25,"saturation":53,"brightness":52,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1416972101,"listing_id":212800837,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/046\/0\/8135139\/il_75x75.688758050_fnat.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/046\/0\/8135139\/il_170x135.688758050_fnat.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/046\/0\/8135139\/il_570xN.688758050_fnat.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/046\/0\/8135139\/il_fullxfull.688758050_fnat.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":688875441,"hex_code":"896147","red":137,"green":97,"blue":71,"hue":24,"saturation":48,"brightness":53,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1416972101,"listing_id":212800837,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/053\/0\/8135139\/il_75x75.688875441_b8hj.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/053\/0\/8135139\/il_170x135.688875441_b8hj.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/053\/0\/8135139\/il_570xN.688875441_b8hj.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/053\/0\/8135139\/il_fullxfull.688875441_b8hj.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":688758022,"hex_code":"7F573B","red":127,"green":87,"blue":59,"hue":25,"saturation":53,"brightness":49,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1416972101,"listing_id":212800837,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/8135139\/il_75x75.688758022_p7r6.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/8135139\/il_170x135.688758022_p7r6.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/8135139\/il_570xN.688758022_p7r6.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/8135139\/il_fullxfull.688758022_p7r6.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500}],"Shop":{"shop_id":8135139,"shop_name":"RaccoonWoodworks","user_id":33462759,"creation_tsz":1368390723,"title":"RaccoonWoodworks","announcement":"Welcome to Raccoon Woodworks, Houston, TX.

While gathering ideas, I began to notice the importance of originality, context, and character in the wine trade.  There&#39;s great pride (from grape seed, to vine, to wine) in the product vineyards and wineries put their names to.  In contrast, there&#39;s great contextual appreciation when an aficionado selects a bottle or glass of wine from a specific country, region, vineyard, or winery.  To capture this essence, I found myself working with original materials including reclaimed wood pieces.  These materials tell a story much like the taste of a sip of wine does.","creation_tsz":1448831687,"ending_tsz":1459282487,"original_creation_tsz":1416969776,"last_modified_tsz":1448831687,"price":"248.99","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"tags":["wine barrel","winery","Wine art","Restaurant","whiskey barrel","wine","wood frame","Barn wood","wine gift","Bar decor","wine wood","wood barrel","Reclaimed wood"],"category_path":["Housewares","Home Decor"],"category_path_ids":[69150425,68892008],"materials":["Reclaimed wood"],"shop_section_id":13611786,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1448823645,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/212801147\/handmade-reclaimed-wood-winery-wine-wall?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":179,"num_favorers":6,"shipping_template_id":17534057202,"processing_min":5,"processing_max":10,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2015","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":null,"is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":1029,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Home D\u00e9cor","Wall D\u00e9cor","Wall Hangings"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":688865257,"hex_code":"7F6145","red":127,"green":97,"blue":69,"hue":29,"saturation":45,"brightness":49,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1416970228,"listing_id":212801147,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/049\/0\/8135139\/il_75x75.688865257_bbm3.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/049\/0\/8135139\/il_170x135.688865257_bbm3.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/049\/0\/8135139\/il_570xN.688865257_bbm3.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/049\/0\/8135139\/il_fullxfull.688865257_bbm3.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":1125},{"listing_image_id":688748196,"hex_code":"553F22","red":85,"green":63,"blue":34,"hue":34,"saturation":60,"brightness":33,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1416970228,"listing_id":212801147,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/047\/0\/8135139\/il_75x75.688748196_26xz.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/047\/0\/8135139\/il_170x135.688748196_26xz.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/047\/0\/8135139\/il_570xN.688748196_26xz.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/047\/0\/8135139\/il_fullxfull.688748196_26xz.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":1125},{"listing_image_id":688748130,"hex_code":"59402C","red":89,"green":64,"blue":44,"hue":27,"saturation":50,"brightness":34,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1416970228,"listing_id":212801147,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/046\/0\/8135139\/il_75x75.688748130_icka.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/046\/0\/8135139\/il_170x135.688748130_icka.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/046\/0\/8135139\/il_570xN.688748130_icka.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/046\/0\/8135139\/il_fullxfull.688748130_icka.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":1125},{"listing_image_id":688865235,"hex_code":"715133","red":113,"green":81,"blue":51,"hue":29,"saturation":54,"brightness":44,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1416970228,"listing_id":212801147,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/054\/0\/8135139\/il_75x75.688865235_jkjh.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/054\/0\/8135139\/il_170x135.688865235_jkjh.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/054\/0\/8135139\/il_570xN.688865235_jkjh.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/054\/0\/8135139\/il_fullxfull.688865235_jkjh.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":1125},{"listing_image_id":688865259,"hex_code":"4D3826","red":77,"green":56,"blue":38,"hue":28,"saturation":50,"brightness":30,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1416970228,"listing_id":212801147,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/050\/0\/8135139\/il_75x75.688865259_fv98.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/050\/0\/8135139\/il_170x135.688865259_fv98.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/050\/0\/8135139\/il_570xN.688865259_fv98.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/050\/0\/8135139\/il_fullxfull.688865259_fv98.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":1125}],"Shop":{"shop_id":8135139,"shop_name":"RaccoonWoodworks","user_id":33462759,"creation_tsz":1368390723,"title":"RaccoonWoodworks","announcement":"Welcome to Raccoon Woodworks, Houston, TX.

Scented Candle. Boyfriend Gift. Husband gift. Husband Christmas. Man Cave. Man Candle. Dad Christmas.","description":"This Whiskey scented candle is the PERFECT boyfriend or husband gift! It has a distinguished aroma reminiscent of honey whiskey and vanilla.  This is a great gift for that man in your life you just can&#39;t find a unique gift for!\ud83c\udf81\n\nSIZE:\n\nMy whiskey scented candle tin has approximately 4 fluid ounces of soy wax and weighs about 5 ounces. Tins are 2&quot; tall and 2 1\/2&quot; in diameter. Each candle is carefully hand-poured in small batches in Philadelphia, PA.\n\nBURN TIME & USE:\n\nEach candle tin has a burn time of up to 32 hours and is comprised of 100% soy wax with cotton wicks, making each one clean burning! My soy candles are eco-friendly and made with GMO free soy beans. Soy candles burn cleaner with less soot and burn longer than traditional paraffin candles. Soy candles are also very easy to clean up with soap and water if spilled. The fragrance oils that I use in my candles are also all phthalate free! The candle tins may be cleaned out and either recycled or reused after the candle has completely burned out. \n\nTo maximize the life of your candles, keep wicks trimmed to 1\/4 inch. Burn 3-4 hours per use. The fragrance of the candle is released when the wax is melted and pools across the surface of the candle. Please keep away from children and pets.\n\n\nFAQ: &quot;ARE YOUR CANDLES STRONGLY SCENTED?&quot;\n\nEach floor plan for each home produces different results. Most get GREAT results with 1 candle (in medium 15 x 15 ft. to smaller rooms), while others need 2 candles. Understand that it is more difficult to fill open floor plan homes since the scent has to continue to travel and as the scent spreads over large areas it will get less intense. An average room with walls will keep the scent inside and of course create a more intense, strong scent.\n\nPACKAGING & GIFTS:\n\nI always wrap items nicely in pretty colored tissue paper so whether your order is for personal use or a gift, it will always be packaged with love and care. If you would like a personal note left for your giftee, please leave the text in the &quot;note to seller&quot; section of the checkout screen.\n\nMORE HANDMADE CANDLES:\n\nPlease be sure to check out some of my other handmade scented soy candles in my shop at: www.Etsy.com\/shop\/GourmetCandle\n\nThank you so much for visiting!\u263a\ufe0f I&#39;d LOVE for you to share my information with your friends and family members!\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\n\nWHOLESALE\/BULK\/CUSTOM ORDERS:\n\nIf you are interested in purchasing candles in bulk or would like a custom order, I\u2019d love to work out a deal, so feel free to send me a message! =)\n\nwww.GourmetCandle.orgwww.GourmetCandle.org","creation_tsz":1448831479,"ending_tsz":1459282279,"original_creation_tsz":1433989550,"last_modified_tsz":1448831479,"price":"8.50","currency_code":"USD","quantity":20,"tags":["husband gift idea","whiskey","husband birthday","husband anniversary","gift for dad","unique candle","candle","soy candle","gift for husband","scented soy candle","Dad birthday gift","boyfriend gift","Husband Christmas"],"category_path":["Candles"],"category_path_ids":[69150375],"materials":["Soy Wax","Quality Fragrance Oil","Candle Tin","Candle Wick"],"shop_section_id":17260451,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1448511602,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/236673262\/4-oz-whiskey-soy-candle-scented-candle?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":1739,"num_favorers":687,"shipping_template_id":2626299641,"processing_min":3,"processing_max":5,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2015","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":2791,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Home D\u00e9cor","Candles & Holders","Candles"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":785895804,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1434040917,"listing_id":236673262,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/067\/0\/8849243\/il_75x75.785895804_nki9.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/067\/0\/8849243\/il_170x135.785895804_nki9.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/067\/0\/8849243\/il_570xN.785895804_nki9.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/067\/0\/8849243\/il_fullxfull.785895804_nki9.jpg","full_height":774,"full_width":552},{"listing_image_id":682702874,"hex_code":"7C6752","red":124,"green":103,"blue":82,"hue":30,"saturation":33,"brightness":48,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1433989551,"listing_id":236673262,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/058\/0\/8849243\/il_75x75.682702874_ar6u.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/058\/0\/8849243\/il_170x135.682702874_ar6u.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/058\/0\/8849243\/il_570xN.682702874_ar6u.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/058\/0\/8849243\/il_fullxfull.682702874_ar6u.jpg","full_height":841,"full_width":1136},{"listing_image_id":703883563,"hex_code":"867780","red":134,"green":119,"blue":128,"hue":324,"saturation":11,"brightness":52,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1433989551,"listing_id":236673262,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/050\/0\/8849243\/il_75x75.703883563_qpxh.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/050\/0\/8849243\/il_170x135.703883563_qpxh.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/050\/0\/8849243\/il_570xN.703883563_qpxh.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/050\/0\/8849243\/il_fullxfull.703883563_qpxh.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1000}],"Shop":{"shop_id":8849243,"shop_name":"GourmetCandle","user_id":40336509,"creation_tsz":1385414364,"title":"Gourmet Candle","announcement":"Thanks for stopping by Gourmet Candle, your one stop shop for all of your Christmas gifts!

However, I can guarantee that if you do choose to get your personalized goodies with me that you will be very satisfied! =)","policy_additional":"Do your candle pies candles burn evenly?\r\nIt takes about 2 hours to achieve a full melt pool since my pies have different wax shapes in them; however, from that 2 hour mark, yes, they will burn evenly.  However, the candle&#39;s fragrance fills the room way before the candle has reached the full melt pool.\r\n\r\nWhat are your candle burn times? \r\n4 oz Candle Tins: up to 32 Hours\r\n4 oz Tropical Bar Jar Candles: up to 32 Hours\r\nCandle Pies: up to 50 Hours\r\n\r\nWhat type of wax and wicks do you use?  \r\nI use soy wax with cotton wicks making my candles natural burning candles.  I have a few candles pies topped with gel wax for a longer burning time and a glazed finish; however, they are indicated as such under the corresponding item.\r\n\r\nDoes the scent throw vary for each home?  \r\nEach floor plan for each home produce different results. Most get great results with 1 candle (in medium-15 x 15 ft. to smaller rooms), some need 2 candles. Understand it is more difficult to fill open floor plan homes since the scent has to continue to travel and as the scent spreads over large areas it will get less intense. An average room with walls will keep the scent inside and of course create a more intense strong scent.\r\n","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1440726359,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/GourmetCandle?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/051\/0\/8849243\/iusb_760x100.14512316_pl6k.jpg","num_favorers":2590,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8849243\/isla_fullxfull.16594517_iviuccme.jpg"}},{"listing_id":258516054,"state":"active","user_id":64213394,"category_id":68887494,"title":"Personalized Whiskey Labels, Birthday Gift, Anniversary Gift","description":"Personalized gifts are fun, meaningful and one of a kind!
