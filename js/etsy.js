ABS does not degrade when exposed to water as PLA does so it makes it an ideal material for planters. Make sure when purchasing 3d printed planters that you make note of the right material so your product lasts a long time! Our planters finish as a clean 3D print, with no cracks on the Bulbasaur.

DSLR Camera Strap! This is a full strap not a cover! Standard Size!","description":"This is a high quality, sturdy camera strap to replace that boring old one that came with your camera. Stop being a billboard and start showing your love of Pok\u00e9mon!\n\nIt is made from a quality medium-weight cotton and displays all your favorite Pok\u00e9mon characters! On the strap you can find Pikachu, Eevee, Squirtle Meowth and more!  They are set against a black background and this strap is reversible so you can display either side depending on your favorite characters!\n\nThe strapping is made from a strong poly webbing (it has a breaking strength of 450 pounds!) and on the webbing you will find a buckle on each side as well as a strap keeper to allow the webbing to hold your camera. These buckles are the same things provided to you on the original factory camera strap when you bought your camera. The poly webbing is attached through black leather on each end, that is stitched to provide extra strength and durability. You will also find that due to the added padding inside the strap this is a more comfortable strap around your neck. \n\nStrap will fit most dSLR cameras and has been modeled after Nikon sizing. Dimensions of this item are 50&quot; from end to end. The strap portion is 24&quot;L x 1.75&quot; W x .2&quot; H. The Nylon webbing is 13&quot; L x .5&quot; W.

The drug quickly becomes popular and is a huge success.\n\nMeanwhile, the International Police has been investigating the mysterious deaths of countless Pok\u00e9mon around the world. Although the investigation was kept under wraps for awhile, people are beginning to take notice. Some people even believe the deaths are beneficial, however many others do not.\n\n\nThus begins your story.\n\nToday is the day you start your journey to become the Champion. But you&#39;re not alone -- many other people have that ambition as well. Among them is a boy named Fatal, your very arrogant neighbor and constant competitor. \n\nEverything is going well, until you walk outside: There are four dead Pok\u00e9mon and a man. It&#39;s a crime scene. The man comes over, and asks if you&#39;ve seen anything. He then introduces himself as Cole Phelps. Phelps explains that he is currently looking into the unexplained deaths of Pok\u00e9mon in the Scimetri nation. He asks for your cooperation in the matter, but advises you to keep the investigation a secret from everyone else.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- All new maps, scripts, Gym leaders, miscellaneous trainers.\n- Very little sound corruption\n- Zero connection to any mainstream Pok\u00e9mon game (no cameos of characters such as Prof. Oak)\n- No &quot;standard&quot; Pok\u00e9mon events such as: Involvement with legendary Pok\u00e9mon, A professor giving you your first Pok\u00e9mon., Tutorials about basic things everybody knows already, and An evil team with no motive besides world domination.\n-HIlarious references (the lowest form of writing) to television shows, movies, songs, books, video games, and U.S. history.\n\n\nPlease check out all of our other Pokemon games as well as other custom games on Etsy.

Born to this world with Entei and Raikou, Suicune has watched over the world since its creation, keeping the world&#39;s harmony in balance. When mankind became corrupt, Suicune&#39;s power purified their hearts. When powerful Pok\u00e9mon tried to seize control of civilization, Suicune defeated them and locked them in hidden prisons for the rest of eternity.\n\nOnly a few humans have ever laid eyes on Suicune. Only one person has ever touched it. It&#39;s beauty and radiance has driven the weak power hungry and insane. Legend has it that Suicune can turn fatal, filthy water into pure, drinkable water. If it is captured, Suicune&#39;s power will turn its captors into gods. For the past few centuries, Suicune has been dormant along with Entei and Raikou because there has been little corruption in the world, until now...\n\nOur story begins with a young child. They wake up and walk downstairs to find their father ecstatic about something. Their father, a world renouned professor on the three legendary dogs, believes he has finally located Suicune after 20 years of research. He gives his child an errand as he leaves to find Suicune. The child then leaves to run the errand, unaware that they are about to be pulled into the adventure of a lifetime...\n\nFeatures:\n- A new region - A new place to explore\n- New rivals - More people to love and hate\n- A new berry system - Watch berries grow and grow\n- Time travel - See how the region used to look\n- Sidequests - Help people out for some yummy rewards\n- Item trees - Small, solitary trees that will occasionally yield items\n- Golden pok\u00e9balls - Rare items and pok\u00e9mon are waiting to be found\n\n\nPlease check out all of our other Pokemon games as well as other custom games on Etsy.

The material is durable, and the edges of the case lay flush against the screen. This case is the slimmest option. Those looking for ease of use and a stylish look prefer the plastic cases. This is what we&#39;ve worn for years.\n\n\u25cf \u2503 FIRM SILICONE\u2503 \u25cf available in White or Black | A firm, protective silicone that has a good grip to it, preventing it from easily slipping from your hands. The case goes past the screen edge of the phone, offering more screen protection. This option is popular due to the protective nature of a silicone case while still being slimmer than a heavy duty case. Please note silicone is a porous material, so I advise those worrying about getting their case dirty from everyday use to choose the black option (white can be stained by things like a lot of make-up, over dyed jeans, etc. ) This has only been an issue a couple of times out of thousands of cases made, but please be aware of this when ordering.\n\n\u25cf \u2503 TOUGH CASE\u2503 \u25cf available in White or Black plastic shell with black lining | Our most durable case is hard plastic and lined with silicone for best phone protection. It&#39;s our heaviest and bulkiest option and goes on in two pieces. Some headphone jacks don\u2019t work with this option.\n\n\u25cf The design of the case will appear the same no matter what option you choose - the back design will be hard and glossy.

Custom cases can take longer as we like everything just right :) We&#39;re just a guy and gal and we do everything from the moment you order to the moment your case is shipped out. We ship cases out USPS First Class shipping, which typically takes 3-5 business days, with the additional option of Priority at 2-3 business days. Orders being sent outside the US are sent via First Class International, with the option of Priority or Express also. Please contact us if you need a case by a specific date before ordering so we can accommodate you. Tracking information can take 24-48 hours to update, and delays due to holidays and storms can occur.\n\n\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\u2508\n\n\u25cf

For this reason, I am limited to how many I can produce in a day.\n\nMy processing-time does not include time in transit. Please keep this in mind when ordering.\n\n****WHEN ORDERING****\nWhen you place your order, I would appreciate it if you add in the notes section the date you need the cutter by. This will help me prioritize orders received on the same day in case of high order volume. \nI try my best to get orders out as quickly as possible and to meet your deadlines; however, providing me with a \u201cneed by date\u201d prior to your \u201cship by\u201d date and earlier than current processing times does not guarantee delivery by that date.   \n\n****SIZING****\nPlease refer to the product photos for sizing. The cookie cutter is shown on a 1\u201d grid for your reference. \n\n****PRODUCT INFORMATION****\nOur cookie cutters are designed to work with dough rolled to \u00bc\u201d (a quarter of an inch), for this reason dough should be rolled to \u00bc\u201d using cheater strips or rolling pin with built in spacer for the best imprint results. We include a recipe that we use to test our cookie cutters. Different depths can be made but need to be communicated prior to ordering and may result in a price increase. \n\n****MATERIAL USED****\nAll cookie cutters are made using our Solidoodle 3D printers with ABS or PLA plastic. These plastics are fairly resilient but to ensure longevity of your cookie cutter, hand wash in warm water and towel dry. Not dishwasher safe and do not use hot water as heat will damage the cookie cutters. \n\n****MATERIAL COLOR****\nYour order will be printed in white but can change depending on what I have in stock. \n\n****CUSTOM DESIGNS****\nIf I don\u2019t have a design in the shop and you would like a cookie cutter made for you please send me a message through ETSY. Generally custom designs start at $20 and includes one cookie cutter plus my time. When messaging me, please include a picture of your requested design for a personalized quote. This will expedite our conversation and ordering process. \n\n\n****RUSH PROCESSING****\nRushed processing is available for a fee of $5 per cookie cutter ordered. Rushed processing gets your order printed same day and mailed out the next day. Since order loads vary day to day, MESSAGE ME DIRECTLY to see if I can accommodate your rush request. \n\n****SHIPPING INFORMATION****\nAll orders are shipped USPS Priority Mail (1-3 day shipping) which is $6 within the US.  Your first cutter ships for $6, all additional cutters ship at NO ADDITIONAL COST. \n\nPriority Express mail (1-2 day) is available at an additional cost of $20, and your order may incur a $5 per cutter rush fee.  Please MESSAGE ME DIRECTLY before requesting Express shipping or ordering. \n\nInternational orders are shipped USPS Priority Mail (6-10 business days).  Your first cutter ships for $24, and all additional cutters ship at NO ADDITIONAL COST.  \n\nExpedited shipping is available for international orders and takes between 3-5 business days to arrive, for expedited international shipping, please MESSAGE ME DIRECTLY so I can make a listing for you. \n\nInternational orders are responsible for all customs charges their government requires.\n \nUnfortunately, I am unable to guarantee shipping timelines because once I send it to the Post Office it is out of my hands. This is especially true for international orders since tracking information only follows the package to the international sort facility. All of our packages are insured and have tracking. If you find that your package has been lost, please message me so we can solve the problem. . \n\n****MESSAGES****\nWhen messaging me please send them through ETSY. If you have a question about your order, please make sure to send the message through your invoice so I can find your order quickly and respond to your question promptly.","creation_tsz":1448832660,"ending_tsz":1459283460,"original_creation_tsz":1426443223,"last_modified_tsz":1448832660,"price":"8.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":18,"tags":["snorlax","cookie","cutter","cutters","pokemon","pikachu","baking","party","mold","birthday","sleeping","squirtle","ash ketchum"],"category_path":["Supplies"],"category_path_ids":[69150433],"materials":["ABS or PLA Plastic"],"shop_section_id":null,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1444918599,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/226307586\/snorlax-pokemon-cookie-cutter?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":213,"num_favorers":101,"shipping_template_id":5103798283,"processing_min":7,"processing_max":7,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":"1","item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":610,"taxonomy_path":["Craft Supplies & Tools","Food Craft Supplies","Baking & Candy","Cookie Cutters"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":742418021,"hex_code":"949593","red":148,"green":149,"blue":147,"hue":90,"saturation":1,"brightness":58,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1426443223,"listing_id":226307586,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/047\/1\/9022217\/il_75x75.742418021_rc35.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/047\/1\/9022217\/il_170x135.742418021_rc35.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/047\/1\/9022217\/il_570xN.742418021_rc35.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/047\/1\/9022217\/il_fullxfull.742418021_rc35.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1500}],"Shop":{"shop_id":9022217,"shop_name":"Geek2Geek","user_id":34205293,"creation_tsz":1389585882,"title":"Geek2Geek Cookie Cutters","announcement":"Please check: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/Geek2Geek\/about?ref=announce for current processing times \r\n\r\nGeek 2 Geek offers many different cookie cutters and even does custom cookie cutters!

International Shipping transit ETA ranges from 5 business days to about 6 weeks, sometimes longer depending on each country&#39;s customs system. This time frame is in addition to our production time as most items are made to order. Please keep the production AND shipping times in mind when placing your order. We are not responsible for post office delays nor can we control how long a package gets held up in customs.\r\n\r\nUSPS and Canada Post have changed their International tracking policy and shipments from Greece and many other countries are not traceable online at the moment. \r\n\r\n\u261bWe do not currently ship to BRAZIL and COLOMBIA.\r\n\r\nCUSTOMS\r\n\r\nIf your delivery address is not within Europe, you may be subject to import duties and taxes, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. Any such additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by you.\r\n\r\n","policy_refunds":"RETURNS\r\n\r\nIf you are not 100% satisfied with your product, you can return it within 30 days from the date of receipt. Items must be in unused condition and returned with all original packaging and accessories. Customer pays for return shipment charges. To ensure that we receive the package we do recommend using a method of shipping with tracking and insurance.\r\n\r\nPersonally customized products created especially for you cannot be returned.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADPHONES\r\n\r\nWe do not manufacture the headphones, we only paint them, therefore we cannot offer a guarantee after the initial 30day period.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAMAGED GOODS\r\n\r\nWe take extra care in packing all orders as securely as possible and we rarely have parcels arriving damaged. As an extra reassurance to our customers we insure all orders against damage during transit and therefore we will replace any orders arriving damaged due to the postal carrier\u2019s negligence. If an order is received damaged please do not accept the delivery. If you realize that an order is damaged after opening the parcel, please record the damaged items.","policy_additional":"PLEASE NOTE: All pieces are painted by hand, so no two items are identical. After you receive your item, please send me a small note or leave feedback so I&#39;ll know the transaction is over and (hopefully) successful. If there are any problems with your order, let me know before leaving any feedback so I can try and solve them.","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1448667028,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/ketchupize?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/018\/0\/6286374\/iusb_760x100.13121026_nmvu.jpg","num_favorers":7708,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/074\/0\/6286374\/isla_fullxfull.15954282_rxvlt85h.jpg"}}],"params":{"limit":25,"offset":0,"page":null,"keywords":"pokemon","sort_on":"created","sort_order":"down","min_price":null,"max_price":null,"color":null,"color_accuracy":0,"tags":null,"category":null,"location":null,"lat":null,"lon":null,"region":null,"geo_level":"city","accepts_gift_cards":"false","translate_keywords":"false","etsy_asap":"false"},"type":"Listing","pagination":{"effective_limit":25,"effective_offset":0,"next_offset":25,"effective_page":1,"next_page":2}};
